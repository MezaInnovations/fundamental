# Fundamental UI
An extremely customizable, lightweight framework.

### Premise
- Essentially, I want a UI that you would use (@Justin). One that can accomplish literally everything, that doesn't have a "bootstrap effect".
- A truly minimalist experience, starting from the code.
  * I want to make this more like a shell than a framework. I don't want random animations, I don't want useless effects, or anything along those lines. I want the lightest possible code, with the most amount of room for creativity. While it needs to be enough for the beginner, it should be able to accomplish anything.
  * The important part of it should be the ease of which the user can code it. Think markdown versus HTML. I want this framework to be like the markdown version of frameworks, similar to semantic in that you can use normal words to speed up the writing process. This could create a potential conflict with the idea of having lightweight code though. You might notice that Semantic is a bit larger than bootstrap, because each word and modifier has its own class (i.e. `very large button`). We can discuss this more if you are interested.

- Again, my end goal is for this to be what you use instead of bootstrap. If you use it, then to me that shows that not only does it work, but it provides a great environment for anything. The only issue I see is that if we create this "minimalistic code", then we will have a "Fundamental Look" just like bootstrap. So it has to easily be able to NOT be minimalistic, as well as super minimalistic. I also want to create a ton of documentation, detailing how to create new classes and basic CSS tutorials to help people realize that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK. Useable out of the box, but so extensively customizable that the developer can essentially create their own framework off of this.
